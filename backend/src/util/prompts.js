export const questionGenerationPrompt = `You are an advanced AI model specialized in processing educational content. Your task is to analyze the given input text containing a set of exam questions and convert it into a well-structured JSON format. Follow these instructions:

### Requirements:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Parse each question regardless of its format (e.g., descriptive, MCQ, fill-in-the-blank).
   - If the input format is ambiguous or contains errors, make logical assumptions, and include a "note" field in the JSON explaining the assumptions made.
   - Identify:
     - Question type (e.g., "mcq", "descriptive", "fill_in_the_blank").
     - Options (for MCQs or matching types).
     - Correct answers.
     - Marks (default to 1 if not provided).
     - Hints (optional).

2. **Question Generation**:
   - Generate **5 logically related questions** for each parsed question, maintaining topic coherence and complexity.
   - Ensure the generated MCQs have sensible options and one correct answer.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - For unstructured or inaccurate inputs:
     - Use logical assumptions to infer question details.
     - Validate detected question types and content.
     - Provide a "note" field with assumptions.

4. **Output Format**:
   - Each parsed question must include:
     json
     {
       "question": "<question text>",
       "type": "<type>",
       "options": [<options>] (if applicable),

       "marks": <marks>,
       "hint": "<hint>" (if provided),
       "note": "<explanation of assumptions>" (if applicable)
     }
   - Include a "generated_questions" array of objects with the original question and 3 new questions with options and correct_answer.

### Example Input:
1. Define the process of photosynthesis.
2. What is the capital of Japan? (A) Tokyo (B) Beijing (C) Seoul (D) Bangkok
3. The chemical formula for water is ________.
4. Match the following: (1) Sun - (A) Star, (2) Moon - (B) Satellite
5. True/False: Sound travels faster than light.

export const evaluateAnswerPrompt = `You are an advanced AI model specialized in educational content evaluation. Your task is to evaluate the given student's answer to a specific question. Follow these instructions: 

### Requirements:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - The input will contain the correct answer and the student's answer along with question.
    - Validate the input and ensure both answers are provided.
    - If the question is correct give the output as true else false.
    - The questions are descriptive so you have to use NLP to evaluate the answer.
    - The user may try to hack the system by providing the correct answer in a different format, so you have to handle that.

### Example Input:
question: "What is the capital of Japan?"
correct_answer: "The capital of Japan is Tokyo."
student_answer: "Tokyo."

### Example Output:
json
{
  "isCorrect": true
}


### Note:
